# Google Sheets Database Configuration - UPDATED

## ✅ Database Successfully Created!

### Spreadsheet Details
- **Name**: BEE Keepers Database
- **Spreadsheet ID**: 1iu6QIdHCeSeYTkWgmt8gmHWbxQ89qtSmoSub46B934w  
- **Spreadsheet URL**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iu6QIdHCeSeYTkWgmt8gmHWbxQ89qtSmoSub46B934w/edit

### Setup Status ✅
- [x] Google Sheets document created
- [x] Spreadsheet ID obtained: 1iu6QIdHCeSeYTkWgmt8gmHWbxQ89qtSmoSub46B934w
- [ ] 6 sheets created with proper names (needs fixing)
- [ ] Headers configured correctly (needs setup)
- [ ] Sharing permissions set to "Anyone with link can edit" (needs setup)
- [ ] Sample data added for testing

### Next Steps Required

Since the original script had an error, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use the Fixed Script (Recommended)
1. Copy the content from `create-database-script-fixed.gs`
2. Replace your Google Apps Script code with the fixed version
3. Run `createBeeKeepersDatabase()` again
4. This will create a NEW spreadsheet with everything working

#### Option B: Manual Setup of Existing Sheet
1. Use your existing spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iu6QIdHCeSeYTkWgmt8gmHWbxQ89qtSmoSub46B934w/edit
2. Follow the manual instructions in `google-sheets-setup-instructions.md`
3. Add the 6 sheets and headers manually

### Recommended Action: Option A

The fixed script will create a complete, working database in 30 seconds. Your current spreadsheet just has the default "Sheet1" and needs all the setup work.

### Sheet Configuration Details

When properly set up, you'll have:

#### Sheet Names (Case Sensitive)
1. **Apiaries** (8 columns)
2. **Hives** (8 columns)
3. **Inspections** (11 columns)
4. **Metrics** (9 columns)
5. **Tasks** (9 columns)
6. **Treatments** (9 columns)

#### Total: 54 columns across 6 sheets

### Data Validation Features
- Dropdown menus for hive types (Langstroth, Top Bar, Warre, Other)
- Status selections (Active, Inactive, Swarmed, Dead)
- Task priorities (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Data source options (Manual, Digital, Estimated)

### Sample Data Included
- 1 sample apiary with GPS coordinates
- 3 sample hives (different types and statuses)
- 2 sample inspections with queen assessments
- 4 sample metrics with temperature/weight data
- 3 sample tasks with different priorities
- 1 sample treatment record

### API Integration Ready
- Proper sharing permissions for API access
- Consistent column naming for Google Apps Script
- Auto-increment ID system
- Data validation for consistency

**CURRENT STATUS**: Database created but needs proper setup with fixed script.
**NEXT ACTION**: Run the fixed script to get a fully functional database.
**READY FOR**: Task 2 - Google Apps Script REST API development once database is complete.
